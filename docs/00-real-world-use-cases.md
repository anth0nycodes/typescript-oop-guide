# Real-World Use Cases for Classes

## When to Use Classes

1. **Domain Models** - Representing business entities (User, Product, Order, Invoice)
2. **Service Layers** - Organizing business logic (PaymentService, AuthenticationService)
3. **Data Structures** - Custom collections (Stack, Queue, LinkedList, Tree)
4. **UI Components** - React class components, form validators, state managers
5. **Game Development** - Entities like Player, Enemy, Weapon, Level
6. **API Clients** - Wrapping HTTP requests (DatabaseClient, APIClient)
7. **Utilities** - Stateful utilities (Logger, Cache, EventEmitter)
8. **Design Patterns** - Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy patterns

## Benefits

- Code organization and reusability
- Encapsulation of related data and behavior
- Clear contracts through interfaces
- Easier testing and mocking
- Better IDE autocomplete and type checking
